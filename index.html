    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      You know Indesign pretty well. But so far you’ve just been working on a few of your own indesign pages.</p>

<p>Creating large magazines in Indesign is a bit more complex. It requires you to manage files carefully and follow a particular workflow.</p>

<p>This page explains the workflow you need to follow to ensure a smooth-running project.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-danger centered" role="alert">
      <p >
        Failure to follow this workflow is likely to cause you massive problems near deadline. Ignore this at your own peril. Support may not be available to fix problems caused by your lack of care.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      This article deals with:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>  where to store your project</li>
    <li>file management strategy</li>
  <li> managing a large publication with an Indesign Book</li>
    <li>preflight checking</li>
  <li>  exporting</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <section class="shared">
    <!-- <h1 class="animated bounce centered mahoosive">Shared space</h1> -->
  </section>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Use a shared production folder</h2>

    <p>
      Your group will be assigned a shared folder in your X: drive. <strong>Use it!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
It’s important to use this shared area to work on your magazine so that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>all your project files are in a central location <i class="fa fa-check"></i></li>
      <li>everyone in the group can access the files <i class="fa fa-check"></i></li>
      <li>your files are safe and secure <i class="fa fa-check"></i></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="alert alert-danger centered" role="alert">
      <p>
        The department will provide a safe and secure area for your group’s magazine project.   </p><p>
          <strong>We advise you use this.</strong>
        </p> <p>
          Failure to do so will be at your own risk!
        </p>
    </div>
<h2>Getting to the X: drive</h2>

<p>
  You can access the X: drive via the start button on all University PCs:
</p>
    <figure>
    <img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/x-drive.jpg" alt="a folder" />
    </figure>
    <p>
Then drill down the relevant levels until you reach your shared group folder:
    </p>

    </figure>
  </div>

<section class="managingIndd">
  <h1 class="mahoosive centered">Managing your Indesign files</h1>
</section>

<div class="container">

  <p>
    Next we'll deal with:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>where to store images</li>
    <li>using an Indesign template</li>
    <li>creating and naming files</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Make a folder for images</h2>

  <figure>
<img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/pics-dir.jpg" alt="" />
  </figure>
<p>
  In your shared group folder on the X: drive, you should create a folder to put <strong>all</strong> your images into.

</p>
<p>
  <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" style="color: #EA4335;"></i> When you place an image into Indesign, it is <strong>linked</strong>. This means that Indesign needs to see the image and it matters greatly what happens to that image. If either the image or Indesign file move, the link is broken. This is problematic!

</p>

<p>
  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" style="color: #34A853;"></i> To avoid problems, always keep all your images in the shared project folder!
</p>

<h2>Use an Indesign Template</h2>

<p>
You should use an Indesign Template so that all pages in your magazine are the same size and have the same basic content e.g. colour swatches, style sheets, master pages.
</p>

<p>
  This should the the first thing you do in Indesign:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>create a document at the right size (e.g A4)</li>
  <li> and add in any new colours, style sheets, master pages and auto page numbers</li>
  <li>go Save As, and choose Template as the file type</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/save-template.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
  Save it into your shared project folder.
</p>

<figure>
<img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/template-in-folder.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>

<h2>Create all your Indesign documents</h2>

<div class="alert alert-danger centered" role="alert">
  <p>
    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Never use a single Indesign file for your whole magazine!
  </p>
  <p>
    If things go wrong, you run the risk of losing the whole thing. You know... Eggs, basket?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" style="color: #34A853;"></i> Create new Indesign documents for each article, feature or section in your magazine.
</p>
<p>
  You will already have a flat-plan. Spend a bit of time creating your Indesign documents based on the flat-plan:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can double-click the template file to create a new Indesign document</li>
  <li>save each Indesign file based on <sup>*</sup>page numbers and content e.g. "1-2 cover and advert.idd", "3-5 contents.idd"</li>
  <li>save them all into your shared project folder</li>
</ul>

<small><sup>*</sup>Prefixing with numbers will be useful later.</small>

<section class="book">
  <h1 class="mahoosive centered">The Indesign Book</h1>
</section>

<div class="container">

  <h2>The Indesign Book</h2>

  <p>
    The Indesign Book is a crucial part of building a large publication out of individual Indesign files.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Book is a special Indesign file that lets you add Indesign documents to organise and export.
  </p>
<p>
  The Book will help you with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>managing auto page-numbering</li>
  <li>performing pre-flight checks</li>
  <li>exporting your whole magazine </li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p>
  For a smooth workflow, create the Book as soon as all the Indesign files have been created.
</p>
</div>

You only need to create one Book file - File > New > Book
<figure>
<img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/make-book.gif" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>
  Save it in your group's shared folder.
</p>

<figure>
<img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/book-folder.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<h2>Add your Indesign files to the Book</h2>
<p>
  Click the <em>add files</em> icon in the book and choose all your Indesign documents. They will be loaded into the Book in alpha-numeric order - That's why it's useful to prefix with page numbers.
</p>

<figure>
<img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/add2book.gif" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>
  Your pages should drop into the book in the correct order. If they're not in the right order, just drag and drop within the book panel.
</p>
</div>

<section class="working">
  <h1 class="mahoosive centered">Close the Book, work on your magazine!</h1>
</section>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Just work!</h2>

  <p>
    Now that the Book has been made and is populated with your magazine's files, you can close it and forget about it for a while.
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll need the Book later on when it's time to check and finalise your magazine ready for handing in and printing.
  </p>

  <h1>Pre-Flight checking</h1>
  <p>
    Pre-flight checking comes near the end when you want to make the final document checks.
  </p>

  <p>
    You need to:
  </p>

  <ul style="list-style:none;">
    <li><i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i> close down all Indesign documents</li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> open the indesign Book</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  In the Book's menu, choose Preflight Book:
</p>
<figure>
<img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/preflight.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>
  In the options, be sure to choose <b>Entire Book</b> and <b>generate report</b>:
</p>

<figure>
<img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/preflight-options.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>
  This will generate a report and tell you if anything is wrong wtih your documents.
</p>
</div>
<section class="finally">
  <h1 class="mahoosive centered">And finally...</h1>
</section>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Loading PDF presets</h2>
    <p>
      You need two versions of your magazine -
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a small sized file to upload to MOLE as your group's submission (and to keep for yourself)</li>
      <li>a high relolution PDF for us to send to the printers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You will need to load a couple of PDF presets before doing this. Download them here:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2volL-59TtqaXJKQV8xRzBGTWs/view?usp=sharing">High resolution preset for professional printing</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2volL-59TtqaHhFRmtCcW9LUms/view?usp=sharing">Normal resolution for on-screen viewing or uploading</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In Indesign, simply go File > Adobe PDF Presets >Define and load the preset files.
    </p>
  <h2>Exporting your Book</h2>

  <p>
  The last thing is exporting your Book, or whole magazine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Do this from your Book's panel menu:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>deselect any selected documents (you may need to scroll to the bottom and cick an empty bit of the book panel)</li>
    <li>from the panel menu, choose <b>Export Book to PDF</b></li>
  </ul>
  <figure>
<img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/book2PDF.png" alt="" />
  </figure>

  <p>
    Choose where you want to save the PDF:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>save the big PDF for printing in your group's folder in a clearly labbeled place e.g. PDF-to-Print/whateverMag-Large.PDF</li>
    <li>save the small one wherever you want. It needs to go onto MOLE</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Check the PDF settings:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>choose he correct PDF setting you just loaded</li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color: #ec4343;"></i> DON'T choose <b>spreads!</b> We won't be able to print these!</li>
  </ul>
  <figure><img class="wow animated fadeInUp" src="img/pdf-out.png" alt="" /></figure>

  <h1 class="centered">Remember, these magazines are large, so they may take a while to export as PDF!</h1>
