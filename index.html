    <p>
      You know Indesign pretty well. But so far youâ€™ve just been working on a few of your own indesign pages.</p>

<p>Creating large magazines in indesign is a bit more complex. It requires you to manage files carefully and follow a particular workflow.</p>

<p>This page is an explanation of the workflow you need to follow to ensure a smooth-running project.

        Failure to follow this workflow is likely to cause you massive problems near deadline. Ignore this at your own peril. Support may not be available to fix problems caused by your lack of care.

    <h2>Start with a shared folder</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Your group will be assigned a shared folder. Use it!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A shared folder means your group members can work together on the magazine in the same place. In Indesign it's essential that good file management is maintained and working from one folder means that all your Indesign files and images are in one place.
